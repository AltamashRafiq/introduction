With the nationwide coronovirus lockdown lifted on 9th May and such an important cultural event ensuing from 24th-26th May, millions of Pakistanis took to the streets with little regard to social distancing and personal hygine guidelines. Seeing this unfold, I could not help but worry that a public health crisis may be just around the corner in Pakistan.\nDespite numerous messages from Pakistani public health officials and international sources such as the World Health Organization, there is still widespread skepticism about COVID-19 in Pakistan. Some believe it doesn’t really exist, some think it is much less severe than it is, and yet others think it exists as only a small part of a grand global conspiracy to microchip the world’s population via vaccines. This, coupled with highly limited COVID-19 testing as well as reports about how patients with other health issues are being deliberately mislabeled as COVID-19 positive to admit them to Pakistani hospitals for treatment, has fueled widespread disregard for protective measures. This ultimately led to an Eid that had only marginally lesser person-to-person interaction than previous Eids. Given that Eid 2020 has likely had many super spreader events due to wide-spread human contact and celebration, I am worried that in the coming weeks, we are likely to see a stark rise in the number of people testing positive per day. This in turn could spell trouble for Pakistan’s healthcare facilities as they would have to manage a deluge of new patients.\nTo get an idea of what kind of numbers we will be seeing in the coming days for new coronavirus cases, I conducted a time series forecasting analysis that I present below. Instead of forecasting just the total coronavirus cases, I chose to forecast new cases as that metric is what we are primarily concerned with when we talk of flattening the curve.\nWorst Case Scenario - Exponential Increase Since I believe the coming days will be a realization of the worst case scenario for COVID-19 spread in pakistan, the first model I created was a polynomial time series regression to do the forecasting for the next 10 days. This modeling choice makes sense in the case of COVID-19 as the disease does demonstrate an exponentially increasing behavior during its early stage in many countries. While the curve of this particular polynomial regression model is quite sharp, it seems suitable when considering the super spreader events on Eid. The form of this model is:\n\\[ \\hat{y_i} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 t_i + \\beta_2 t_i^2\\] \\[y_i = New \\; Cases_i \\; \\; \\; t_i = Time_i\\]\nHere, time is simply the number of days since 1st March 2020. The mean values of the parameters are: \\(\\beta_0 = -13.41\\), \\(\\beta_1 = -1.02\\), and \\(\\beta_2 = 0.33\\). The model parameters were estimated using frequentist maximum likelihood estimation. Below, I plot the mean forecast values for the next 10 days as well as the 80% and 95% prediction intervals of the forecast.\nThis forecasting model suggests that the coming days will see a stark rise in the number of new cases per day, potentially even entering the range of 3,000 new cases per day. This may be devastating for the Pakistani healthcare system which could be pushed to its limits in trying to deal with the influx of new patients.\n Conservative Forecast The second forecasting method I attempted to guage the severity of the situation in the coming days was an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The model parameters were estimated and deduced using conditional-sum-of-squares to find starting values followed by fequentist maximum likelihood estimation. This led me to an ARIMA(0,1,1) model which takes the following form:\n\\[ \\hat{y_t} = \\mu + y_{t-1} + \\theta_1\\epsilon_{t-1}\\] \\[\\epsilon_{t-1} = y_{t-1} - \\hat{y}_{t-1}\\] Here the mean values of the parameters are: \\(\\mu = 22.24\\), and \\(\\theta_1 = -0.74\\). Below, I plot the mean forecast values for the next 10 days as well as the 80% and 95% prediction intervals of the forecast.\nWhile this model’s forecast is more conservative than that of the polynomial regression, it still suggests that the number of new COVID-19 cases per day in Pakistan is expected to rise in the coming days. This model, however, does little to account for the super spreader Eid events. This leads me to believe that the worst-case-scenario forecast is more reasonable than the conservative one.\nBoth forecast scenarios suggest that COVID-19 is spreading faster by the day in Pakistan. While Pakistan currently does not have wide spread testing, a rise in the number of new cases per day among the people to whom tests have been administered is likely to still be indicative of a more general rise in the number of new cases per day in Pakistan. It is important to note here that a more comprehensive forecasting model for this data would include number of tests administered as a predictor variable. This would, however, require forecasting the number of tests administered per day as well as missing value imputation for days where the number of test administered is unavailable. It would also likely lead to an insignificantly different forecast to the one already obtained. As such, I may attempt this in a subsequent post.\n ","date":1590537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590609892,"objectID":"41170dd2adf340f2571ea5f26b1361ea","permalink":"/post/covid_forecast/forecasting-coronavirus-cases-in-pakistan/","publishdate":"2020-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/covid_forecast/forecasting-coronavirus-cases-in-pakistan/","section":"post","summary":"Note: Code for this post can be found here\nThe past three days marked the 2020 Eid celebrations in my home country of Pakistan, the most awaited religious celebration of the year, akin to Christmas in the US.

As a child, I had learnt English by watching American cartoons that showed children of many different races living together and going on fantastic adventures that I couldn’t take my eyes off of. As I grew older, I began thinking of the US as an almost a magical place that epitomized racial harmony, a belief that eventually transformed into a desire to see this harmony for myself. This, among many other factors, led me to apply to colleges in the US and make the decision to pursue my undergraduate studies at Duke.\nAll of this changed on the 12th of August 2014 when, as I unpacked my bags in New York, I watched footage of police clashing with rioters in Ferguson, Missouri, in the aftermath of the shooting of Michael Brown. I had come face to face with the reality of racial tensions in the United States of America. Upon commencing my undergraduate studies later that month, I began to educate myself about the history of racial tensions in the US and to understand the pervasive problem of gun violence that has singed the face of this country for many many years.\nFive years later, I arrived at Duke on the 1st of August 2019 for a Master’s degree, this time knowing full well about the prevalence of mass shootings in this country. This knowledge, however, did little to prepare me for the news just three days after my arrival of mass shootings in both El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. As I have reflected over these shooting over the past two weeks, I have been motivated to explore the recent history of mass shootings in the US as the topic of my first Data Blog. I hope that in the process of making the interactive data visualizations I share on this page, I may learn more about the history of guns in the US and the increasingly prevalent phenomenon of gun violence.\nIn the past two week, I have learnt that a mass shooting is a rather tricky term to define. Different groups have different understandings of what to characterize as a mass shooting and numbers differ between sources; some groups would argue that there have been 254 mass shootings in the US since the start of 2019 while others would enforce a more stringent criteria and suggest that there have been only 7 shootings major enough to be characterized as ‘mass’ shootings. It is this latter, more stringent criteria that I have used for the majority of the interactive plots on this page.\nThe map at the top of this post attempts to summarize much that I have found about the major mass shootings in the US since 2010. Each point on the map represents a major mass shooting and the size of each point indicates the number of people killed in that shooting. If you hover over the point, subsequent details like the number of people killed and injured as well as the type of weapons used in the shooting should appear along with some basic information about the shooting. If you click a point, you will be redirected to a different webpage with detailed information about that shooting.\nNext I have decided to plot the number of people killed and injured (combined) in major shootings in the US. Over the past few years, mass shootings have been more and more in the news and I suspect this is because of the number of people who have been impacted by (i.e. been victim of) major mass shooting. Certainly, the following plot affirms that people injured or killed in major mass shootings has sky rocketed in recent years, propelling the topic of mass shootings to the forefront of American consciousness.\nNote: It is still just August in 2019 so the data for 2019 is not complete.\n Hover over the plot to learn more     {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/data_blog_1/data-blog-1_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-2.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}  Next, I was interested in the gun debate side of mass shootings. There is now a large number of people in the US who support the ban or limitation of semiautomatic weapons. They believe that this limitation will, if not lower the number of mass shootings, at least limit the victim toll of these shootings. To visualize the difference between the number of victims of shootings involving semi-automatic weapons and other guns, I produced the following box plot. Note: The box plot ignores some major outliers in the semi-automatic weapons category that would have made the difference between the two types even more stark.\n Hover over the plot to learn more     {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/data_blog_1/data-blog-1_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-3.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}  As is clear from this plot, there appears to be a significant difference between the number of victims of each type of mass shooting. It is important here, however, to mention some limitations of the data plotted above: often the date was unclear about whether or not the weapon listed was either semi of fully automatic, despite significant data cleaning on my part. In cases of doubt, the shooting has been characterized as involving ‘Other Weapons’. More accurate data as well as domain knowledge about weapon types is needed for a more comprehensive conclusion about whether or not semi-automatic weapons lead to more victims and therefore should indeed be restricted.\nFinally, I wanted to take a moment to explore data for all the mass shootings in 2019, not just the major shootings. In pursuit of this goal, I made the following plot to visualize the frequency and human toll of the shootings this year. Note: In an effort to make a smoother and more informative plot, instead of making each point represent the number of shootings and victims on each day, I instead made it represent a 5 day moving average of victims and shootings.\n Hover over the plot to learn more     {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/data_blog_1/data-blog-1_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-4.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}  It seems that as the year has progressed, the number of mass shootings has begun to fluctuate more and more while the number of victims per shooting appears to be on the rise. This plot suggests a trend of increasing destructiveness in the mass shooting activity for this year, leaving me with a sense of anxiety about what is to follow in the rest of this year and beyond. It is genuinely frightening to see the frequency and terrible impact of mass shootings in America and I am now certainly more preoccupied with the gun debate than ever before.\n","date":1565222400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565314476,"objectID":"803df0f5eab110223b9c12fee899e981","permalink":"/post/data_blog_1/data-blog-1/","publishdate":"2019-08-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/data_blog_1/data-blog-1/","section":"post","summary":"Hover over or click a point to learn more about the incident     {\"x\":{\"url\":\"/post/data_blog_1/data-blog-1_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-1.html\",\"options\":{\"xdomain\":\"*\",\"allowfullscreen\":false,\"lazyload\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}  If you, dear reader, had met me five years ago when I stepped foot in the United States for the first time, you would have met a man convinced that the US represented a land of peace, unity and racial indifference.
